Here I will tell step by step how to connect database to login or signin.
First, You need to download XAMPP app and PHPMAILER document from GITHUB.
Download and set-up the XAMPP, and remember where the app files and itself located. (On linux systems it is in /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run)
We will be using XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs folder for our project, create a seperate folder on there and add all of the backend and frontend files.
So does the PHPMAILER folder, add it to the folder that you have created.
Secondly, check signup and login scripts, there are two things that you need to change,
    1. XAMPP directory.
    2. Your database connection details.
Save your changes, and then head into XAMPP app, go to manage servers and start all of the servers.
(if you run signup.html from VScode forget this part)When you click signup.html, make sure that url is localhost/SoftwareEngineering/signup.html
And you should be ready, any questions, don't hesitate ask me. I have added instructions on singup.php as-well, just in case you face with problems.
